   <h1 id="main">Prepare ahead of time.</h1>
   <p>Increasing your home cooking is beneficial to both your health and your pocketbook. Even the busiest week can accommodate it with a little forward preparation. Making the most of your time in the kitchen is the aim. Be particular when outlining your meals for the coming week. Even better, create a simple menu for each day of the week, such as chili on Monday, pasta on Thursday, and tacos on Friday. It can facilitate planning, and some individuals, particularly children, enjoy knowing what to anticipate.</p>

   <h1>Choose Easy Recipes.</h1>
   <p>Start off easy. Easy to prepare and reheat are roasted veggies,lentils and rice. On the other hand, meals like tofu and stew need more work and might not remain as fresh. Save a recipe you find that seems nice in a file or spreadsheet. Make a list of all the ingredients you need to buy after making your selections, including how much of each. You can determine precise amounts with the use of apps and other online resources. </p>

   <h1>Don’t crowd your cooking area.</h1>
   <p>As food cooks, moisture is released. Your food will begin to steam itself rather than brown when pans are packed, which will alter the texture of the food. The outside of potatoes baked in the oven won't be as crisp, and meat won't brown as nicely. Give your meal plenty of space in the pan, particularly when browning or baking items that require crispness </p>

   <h1>Buy  more fresh vegetables</h1>
   <p>A fantastic location to look is at farmers' markets.Unusable onions can still be used if they aren't too old. However, it won't be as strong and zingy. Just be aware that the finished product won't have as much flavor. You might in this case omit the recipe's specified amount of onion and add a bit extra. </p>

   <h1>Master Portion Sizing</h1>
  <p>You may be able to save yourself some time during the week by dividing large recipes into single servings that are ready to go. You may be prevented from overeating by it as well. Place each portion in a glass jar or resealable plastic bag. Additionally, you can put soups, stews, and broths into silicone muffin tins, freeze them, then place the solidified pieces of food into plastic bags.</p>
